# Income Prediction: EDA and ML

## Income inequality -
 Income is distributed in an uneven manner among a population - is a growing problem for governments and law makers in developing nations across the world.  This problem could continue to grow if steps are not taken to address the issue.
 However, with the rapid rise of AI and work automation this can be easly dictected.

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to predict whether an individual earns above or below a certain amount.

This solution can potentially reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of monitoring key population indicators such as income level in between census years. This information will help policymakers to better manage and avoid income inequality globally.
