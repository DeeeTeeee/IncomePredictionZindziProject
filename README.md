## Income inequality -
Within the context of developing nations, the stark imbalance in income distribution has assumed a prominent position, shrouding the future in a veil of ambiguity. Today, as we delve deeply into the core of this pivotal concern, we extend an invitation to you to join us on a voyage of discovery and pioneering solutions.

Our objective is unequivocal: to create a machine learning model with the ability to predict an individual's income status, be it surpassing or falling below a specified threshold. This model will act as a guiding light, illuminating the path towards a future where we can address income inequality with precision and unwavering determination.
